Wow... Loved this place.	1
Crust is not good.	0
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty.	0
A very, very, very slow-moving, aimless movie about a distressed, drifting young man.  	0
Not sure who was more lost - the flat characters or the audience, nearly half of whom walked out.  	0
Attempting artiness with black & white and clever camera angles, the movie disappointed - became even more ridiculous - as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost non-existent.  	0
Needless to say, I wasted my money.	0
What a waste of money and time!.	0
And the sound quality is great.	1
